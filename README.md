# PythonATT
notes from ATT Python I class

note: repo not complete

In particular, the ex15-8.py script is unfinished. It does not handle
serialization correctly, so the information can't be stored and
retrieved to disk yet. It does have an interesting and flexible
generic input system, however. I will try to finish and comment it
before Sept 1, 2016.
